Seems it would be much simpler than using the VM Locator, and for whatever reason in my mind I can't envision how this would work with the VM Locator, unless it involves also using the messenger service.  Anyone care to elaborate about how you can use the VM Locator for an observable collection of vm's?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nDon<br />\n",

Every example I've found seems to focus on a single view rather than any kind of menu driven, multiple windowed application. I can only assume that a lot of this is due to the tendency for a lot of MVVM's proponents being Silverlight developers.</p>\r\n<p>Once I get this project finished I think I'm going to blog about my experiences and hopefully help anyone who finds themselves in the same situation as myself.</p>",

This is a neat, code-less way to start, stop etc a Storyboard.</p>\r\n<p>A simple way is also to define your animations by creating states for your page, and transitions between the states. Then you can use the VSM to trigger the states, for example with a Blend behavior again.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

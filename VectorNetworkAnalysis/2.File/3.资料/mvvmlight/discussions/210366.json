I am trying to develop a MainWindow (say a Grid as main Container) which should dynamically inyect a UserControl in the Grid (both inserting and removing diferent instances of the UserControl in the Grid as the app runs).</p>\r\n<p>Most of the examples about MVVM inyect a set of data by Binding using a ListView, ListBox,... with the ItemSource property. But, what about if I want to inyect a new Children directly to the Grid. How I should do the Binding?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>",

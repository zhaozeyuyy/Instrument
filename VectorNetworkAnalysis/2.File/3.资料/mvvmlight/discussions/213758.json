Instead, add a &quot;Create&quot; method, which takes the HTML parameters as argument, and pass these arguments to the MainViewModel's constructor.</p>\r\n<p>This is the main advantage of the ViewModelLocator pattern: You have total control over the viewmodels' lifetime.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>MVVM Light is a toolkit providing components that help to build loosely coupled. It also pays a lot of attention to facilitating the designer-developer workflow by optimizing the interaction with Expression Blend.</p>\r\n<p>I would not compare MVVM Light to Prism. First, Prism is much more complex and has more features than MVVM Light. Their aim is also not quite the same.</p>\r\n<p>Some features of Prism can be replaced by a combination of the Managed Extensibility Framework MEF and MVVM Light. Similarly, some features of MVVM Light can be fulfilled by using components of Prism.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully this helps,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

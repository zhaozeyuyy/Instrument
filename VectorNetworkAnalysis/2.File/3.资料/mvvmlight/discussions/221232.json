The only problem with this approach is, that i want the error handler in my View class (i just need it for displaying - no rollback logic or so - just some GUI vodoo). Would it be possible to add a Attached property for error handling so that i can provide a error handler (at the View)?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks<br>michael</p>\r\n<p>PS: MVVM Light Toolkit is a greate framework!!! I like the light approach!!!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

So please let me ask it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've just got the latest binaries for SL4, and tried to implement the RelayCommand as your sample http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2009/09/26/using-relaycommands-in-silverlight-and-wpf.aspx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, no luck, I couldn't compile because of the following xaml code,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;button cmd:ButtonBaseExtensions.Command={Binding SubmitCommand} Content=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe error said something like &quot;ButtonBaseExtensions doens't have a Command&quot;. Of course I included the namespace 'cmd', but it's weird since I searched for the ButtonBaseExtensions in both GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Extras.SL4.dll and GalaSoft.MvvmLight.SL4.dll by using the Reflector, there is no such a class or a property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've achieved what I wanted using EventToCommand, but I want to know where the ButtonBaseExtensions has gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers.<br>\r\nyokyo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I must say before I leave, 'Thank you for such a great toolkit!!'",

You can use:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;Button Command={Binding SubmitCommand} Content=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers, Laurent</p>",

Will the toolkit's Messenger</p>\r\n<p>utility work across Winforms/WPF and can we build it into a VS2005 dll?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Joseph.</p>\r\n",

It relies on generics and WeakReference, so maybe you need to make sure that these are available, i cannot remember if they are. It has been too long since I did .NET 2.0...</p>\r\n<p>You will need to copy the source code file in your project and build separately, the DLLs will probably not work.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>\r\n",

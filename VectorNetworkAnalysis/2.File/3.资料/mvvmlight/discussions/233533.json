There were a couple of issue. First the GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Test suite failed to complete. I also created\r\n a test app (SL4) that attempted to use EventToCommand. This all compiled fine but the command (on MouseEnter of a TextBox) never fired. I have all the prerequisites. The RelayCommand to a ButtonBase works fine, it's only the EventToCommand that seems to be\r\n broken.</p>\r\n<p>I'd appreciate any advise you may have on this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Arch</p>\r\n",

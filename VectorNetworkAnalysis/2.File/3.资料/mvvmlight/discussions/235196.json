    "Html": "<p>Laurent,</p>\r\n<p>We were getting a <strong>InvalidOperationException </strong>on a collection being modified during one of the foreach loops in <strong>CleanupList()</strong>. &nbsp;It was on the line that says</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">foreach</span> (WeakActionAndToken item <span style=\"color: blue;\">in</span> list.Value)\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The situation was basically that we were doing a lot (couple of thousands) of register's very rapidly. &nbsp;We were also doing a bunch of send's during those register's. &nbsp;Our system was generally being hammered by a lot of processing, as this was a stress test that we were doing. &nbsp;We did see that there was a lock in <strong>CleanupList() </strong>on the <strong>lists </strong>object. &nbsp;The scope of the lock that was already there was on everything in the method except for the<strong> if (lists == null)</strong> check. &nbsp;We did not see a corresponding lock on an equivalent object to \"<strong>lists</strong>\" in the <strong>Register()</strong> method. &nbsp;There is a lock on the <strong>_registerLock </strong>object, but the equivalent of the \"<strong>lists</strong>\" object, which in <strong>Register()</strong> is \"<strong>recipients</strong>\" (a reference to <strong>_recipientsStrictAction </strong>or <strong>_recipientsOfSubclassesAction</strong>) does not have a lock. &nbsp;Perhaps I am misunderstanding what is going on here, but to me this seemed to be an issue. &nbsp;We ended up putting a lock on the \"<strong>recipients</strong>\" object as was suggested by dmehers to encompass all of the code in <strong>Register() </strong>after \"<strong>recipients</strong>\" is set. &nbsp;This seemed to correct our initial issue. &nbsp;The reason I wrote my first message was because we were applying the lock incorrectly (I think). &nbsp;I don't remember how we were locking in<strong> Register()</strong>, but the lock I explained earlier seems to have fixed our issue.</p>\r\n<p>But then we ran into another exception. &nbsp;We got another <strong>InvalidOperationException</strong>&nbsp;on a collection being modified, but this time it was in the <strong>SendToList()</strong> method. &nbsp;This was on the line that says&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">foreach</span> (WeakActionAndToken item <span style=\"color: blue;\">in</span> list)\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This seemed to be&nbsp;occurring when <strong>SendToList()</strong>&nbsp;is called based on<strong>&nbsp;_recipientsStrictAction</strong>. &nbsp;We don't use any messaging that includes the subclasses, so it may be an issue there as well but we didn't see it through our tests. &nbsp;What we ended up doing to fix this was removing the <strong>listClone</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>SendToList()</strong>. &nbsp;Instead, we ended up putting locks around&nbsp;<strong>list = _recipientsOfSubclassesAction[type];</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>List&lt;WeakActionAndToken&gt; list = _recipientsStrictAction[messageType];</strong>&nbsp;in the <strong>SendToTargetOrType() </strong>method by locking the <strong>_recipientsOfSubclassesAction</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>_recipientsStrictAction</strong>&nbsp;objects respectively. &nbsp;Inside of those locks, we performed the list cloning using <strong>Take()</strong>&nbsp;to replace the <strong>listClone</strong>&nbsp;that we removed from <strong>SendToList()</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope this makes sense and that it doesn't introduce other errors. &nbsp;Based on our testing over the last couple days, these two fixes corrected any exceptions that we had been seeing. &nbsp;If it would help that I send you our version of the Messenger class, please let me know. &nbsp;I guess I could also post the two methods (<strong>Register() </strong>and <strong>SendToTargetOrType()</strong>) that we changed in its entirety... &nbsp;I will try to remember to do that.</p>\r\n<p>I hope this helps. &nbsp;MVVM Light has helped us out immensely, and we owe a lot to the community and to Laurent in particular. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>",

What is the most elegant way of doing that?</p>\r\n<p>I'm consider doing it this way:</p>\r\n<p>1) In the Application_Startup event in App.xaml.cs I show a dialog (view: loginForm.xaml) where the user has to submit valid credentials</p>\r\n<p>2) If credentials is valid. Navigate to the MainView.xaml</p>\r\n<p>Is there any session-object in Silverlight that I can save information about the user and his role? Different roles has different access to my application. This is regular business application functionality and I hope there is some good samples for scenarios\r\n like this.</p>\r\n",

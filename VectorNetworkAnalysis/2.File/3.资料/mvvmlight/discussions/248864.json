I can't include all this\r\n in my SCM, so I have to clean them before checkin (I'm using TFS, which proposes me to upload all those files).</p>\r\n<p>I would have preferred that there was one Nuget package for each technology, so I can get only MvvmLight for WPF 4.0. Also templates and snippets should be appart, so I could get it separatelly (or maybe via another Nuget package). It would make the process\r\n more straightforward, only taking into account required files.</p>\r\n<p>I just have commented this with Laurent via Twitter, but now I realize this is the appropiate channel to do this suggestion.</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Hey Pablo,</p>\n<p>About 1 package per technology, I tend to disagree. Nuget has a mechanism allowing to add different technologies in the same package (in subfolders), allowing the correct technology to be picked automatically. I think it is less confusing for the user, as he is just picking \"MVVM Light\" from the catalog, instead of having to pick \"MVVM Light for Silverlight 4\" for instance. Also, this clutters the catalog less, offering only one global MVVM Light package.</p>\n<p>Regarding the automated installer, this is something that installs everything (snippets and templates in Studio, binaries in C:\\program files, etc) while Nuget installs only the references to the binaries. However this will note replace Nuget, it's just a different offering.</p>\n<p>Makes sense?</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Laurent</p>",

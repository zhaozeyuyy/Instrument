This can break the application if other classes or XAML require a reference to\r\n<strong>System.Windows.Interactivity</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Is this the expected behaviour? I'm new to NuGet, but shouldn't it support checking for shared references in the project before blindly removing references for assemblies contained in the NuGet Package?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, <br>\r\nRichard</p>\r\n",

I'm not using ViewModelBase, just\r\n RelayCommand from MVVMLight. Tried fiddling with the source code by adding DataContract and DataMember attributes, seems the Action and Func&lt;bool&gt; types are not serializable&nbsp;(of course).</p>\r\n<p>So this means I can't just serialize and deserialize my vm, I need to do extra work to reinitialize the commands after it's deserialized.&nbsp;Any better suggestions ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Yacine&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

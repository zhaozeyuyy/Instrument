The project templates, item templates and code snippets in MVVM Light are targeted at Visual Studio, so there is a possibility that they do not work on #develop (except of course if the team decided to support the same formats, which would be a clever thing to do I guess). The components in the DLLs will work just fine, since eventually this is all .NET.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

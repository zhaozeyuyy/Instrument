The folder that is of interest to me, as a WPF developer, I assume is GalaSoft.MvvmLight (NET4). Right? But within this folder,\r\n I see all fluff and no puff!&nbsp; No .cs files. Within the Command folder: nothing. Within the Helpers folder? nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Within the GalaSoft.MvvmLight (NET35) folder, however, I do see files. Gang's all there.</p>\r\n<p>GalaSoft.MvvmLight (SL4) however, also doesn't have anything within it (except for fluff - csproj, snk, StyleCop). ?</p>\r\n<p>Are you going to upload an update soon to supply the missing files for us .NET 4.0 developers?</p>\r\n<p>Also, btw - when I first opened your VS 2010 solution, many of the projects were not loadable.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>James Hurst</p>\r\n<p>VS 2010 Ult, SP1&nbsp; (which still crashes several times/day, incidentally)</p>\r\n",

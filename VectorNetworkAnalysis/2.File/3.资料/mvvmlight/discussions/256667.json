Can I keep the Visual in VM?</p>\r\n<p>2. I am planning to make the common Print view that has the header,footer and body UI element and all properties are bound with VM.</p>\r\n<p>How can I call common Print view from any VM? Hope we should not have the reference of View in the VM. How could we archieve this?</p>\r\n<p>Need the architectural guidance on this. Please advise.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Mani</p>\r\n",

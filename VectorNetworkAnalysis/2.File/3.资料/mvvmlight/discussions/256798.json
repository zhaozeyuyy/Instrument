Trying to use them in Visual Studio Ultimate does not work at all. Clearly they are added in the Code Snippet Manager and also being shown as available but they are simply not working when trying to use them  in code (e.g. <em>mvvmlocatorpropert</em>y). I have not idea why that is the case. Can anybody help me with that?</p>\n<p>Available in Code Snippet Manager</p>\n<p>http://www.imagebanana.com/view/b8b5gw7j/Prob1.png</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just not working in code (Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate)</p>\n<p>http://www.imagebanana.com/code/psk8pi7p/Prob2.png</p>",

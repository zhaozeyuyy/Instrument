Some of the nested UserControls would have another one nested in them and they would be again dynamically loaded based on a ListBox selection.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if this is possible using your static VM Locator, and also how to notify the View that it needs to load a different User Control.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edit: I have a separate ViewModel for each dynamicaly loaded UserControl and actually the approach i am taking right now is to assign different viewmodel objects to a property, to which then I bound the content of ContentControl element. I am using Entity framework for generating my model entities, not sure if this somehow affects the framework.</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appriciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

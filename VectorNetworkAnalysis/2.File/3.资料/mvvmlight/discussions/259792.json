    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>The BL16 (BL stands for base level) is a preview build indeed. I still have work to do on V4 before I can call it a stable release. However changes from V3 to V4 are incremental, and I try not to introduce breaking changes (though some APIs might be marked as deprecated). As such, i recommend the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you need a feature present only in V4 (the SimpleIoc comes to mind), then I recommend you swap already now.</li>\r\n<li>If not, then I rather recommend staying on V3 until I release a more stable V4.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

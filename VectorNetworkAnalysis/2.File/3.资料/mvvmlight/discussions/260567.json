But I haven&acute;t find clear solution in my google results.</p>\r\n<p>I&acute;m starting a new application with MVVM Light. Basically I have a main window, and a lot of other views. I just need to show this views (Modal or not Modal) &nbsp;when the user clicks some controls in the main window. But of course I dont want to\r\n break the View - ViewModel separation of concerns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I see the MessageDialog from Laurent, and what I need is more or less the same but for showing my own views.</p>\r\n<p>The idea is simple, but I haven&acute;t found any clear way to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

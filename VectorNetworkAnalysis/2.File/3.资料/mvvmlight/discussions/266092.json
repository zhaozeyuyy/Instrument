    "Html": "<p>Hi</p>\n<p>The Reactive Framework is a great toolset to realize ansychronous datastreams.<br />For this I created some \"Duplex Communication Messages\" which have a Method like this<br /><strong>Reply(... Data...)</strong></p>\n<p>In my scenario Data Is a IObservable so its</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">void</span> Reply(IObservable&lt;T&gt; dataStream);\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>the Message itself implements IObservable&lt;T&gt;. So the UI can subscribe to the message and update the viewcollection when data is stream.</p>\n<p>For example like this:</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre>ReadTasksMessage msg = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> ReadTasksMessage();\n\nmsg.SubscribeOn(Scheduler.ThreadPool).ObserveOnDispatcher().Subscribe(task =&gt; <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.TaskCollection.Add(task));<br />this.Messenger.Send(msg); <br /></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Now some kind of adapter receives the message, reads the Data and returns it to the ui like this.</p>\n<p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre>Messenger.Register(msg =&gt;\n{\n  <span style=\"color: green;\">// ... readTasks...</span>\n  msg.Reply(myObservableResult);\n});\n</pre>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It would be really great to get some mvvm light baseclasses to this.&nbsp; <br />If there are some people interesseted i would also contribute my source .</p>",

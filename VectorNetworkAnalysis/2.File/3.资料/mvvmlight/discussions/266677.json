I wired the button with RelayCommands to the ViewModel, so thats already working fine.&nbsp;I figured out, that it is easy to start and stop the MediaElement  via a CodeBehind file of the MainView, but I like to control the MediaElement from within the ViewModel via the RelayCommands. So I thought to inject a reference to the MedieElement in to the ViewModel. As I find out the ViewModelLocator is contructed first,  and this will contruct the ViewModel and at last the MainView is constructed, so an injection won't work in this case.</p>\n<p>So, what would be the best solution to let the ViewModel receive a reference to the MediaElement? Messages?</p>\n<p>best regards</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Bernhard</p>\n<p>ps: I also asks this on stackflow</p>",

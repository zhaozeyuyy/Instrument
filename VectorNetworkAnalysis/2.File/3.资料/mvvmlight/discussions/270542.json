Having a look at my messenger code which uses callbacks in places I'm not 100% sure how I'd port that back to VB.NET.<br />\n<br />\nI know moving to C# from VB.NET may seem like big step but it may be worth it in the long run, your skills will be more in demand. Prism has full VB samples but we only use Prism for the modularity part as we have a shell decoupled from the application modules, this approach works very with to MVVM Light.<br />\n",

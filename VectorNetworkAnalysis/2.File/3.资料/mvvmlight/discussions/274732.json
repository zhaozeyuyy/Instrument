It seems that there is an issue because the custom action is using .NET 4 and Windows 8 comes with .NET 4.5 only by default. It works on my machine because I also have VS10 installed side by side, and this installs .NET4.</p>\r\n<p>The first issue (RodWatkins) is not something I have seen anyone else reporting. As soon as I have a fix for the second issue, I will pass the link to you guys for testing, and if it doesn't fix Rod's issue, I will work with you directly on that.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks<br />Laurent&nbsp;</p>",

I assume that you guys also have the \"vanilla\" package with only VS11 Express, and no VS11 Ultimate installed, is that right?</p>\r\n<p>Ignore the previous message with the MSI, i will now make a VHD with a vanilla Win8 install and fix the MSI.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

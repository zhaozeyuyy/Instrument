At the moment, I see two possible ways to do this</p>\r\n<p>1) I do the messaging for each IList and receive the messages step-by-step<br>\r\n2) Or I will create a class, which holds all 5 of this IList's and transfer this class.</p>\r\n<p>So, what will be the better solution?</p>\r\n<p>And an additional question: When I want to give this List's back again to the master Control (after they have been changed), will the GenericMessage(of T) be the best thing for this?\r\n<br>\r\nOr is there an other way with a better solution?</p>\r\n<p>THX - Have a nice weekend</p>\r\n",

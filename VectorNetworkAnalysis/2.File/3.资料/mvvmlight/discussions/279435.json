My goal was to make the implementation closer from the Silverlight one, and also to avoid using the CommandManager class which always seemed flaky to me.</p>\r\n<p>However this is a breaking change that has been annoying some users (which I can understand), so I am considering reverting to an implementation allowing using the CommandManager or (optionally) to use the Silverlight way.</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for the worries in the meantime. I would recommend keeping the V3 implementation for the time being.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

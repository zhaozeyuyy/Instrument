Using a DO there is overkill because DOs are quite heavy and \"drag\" with them a lot of features that only make sense on a UI. For instance, DOs are not serializable while INPC implementations are, of course.</p>\r\n<p>In MVVM Light V4, you can use the ObservableObject class and derive from this.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>",

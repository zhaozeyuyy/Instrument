I&quot;m using the messenger class to alert when info is ready to be updated on the article.&nbsp; So at that point there shouldn't be any memory leak issue with even references.</p>\r\n<p>It's my understanding that when the user clicks back, the view is destroyed.&nbsp; Since the viewModel is not destoryed though, is it holding onto PropertyChanged events for each bound element for old views??</p>\r\n<p>I've been combing through my code to look for anything that I didn't realize could be keeping a reference and this is all I can think of.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

Then, we can try to load up the WinRT class, which will fail in SL. Finally, we can try to load the SL version.</p>\r\n<p>In this way, we ultimately know which system it's running on and since the properties we need are all public, there aren't any blockers with using reflection to get the values.</p>\r\n<p>Oren</p>",

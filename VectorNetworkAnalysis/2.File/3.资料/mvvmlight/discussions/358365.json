On the New Scenario, I can used my CustViewModel with default constructor ( no param ).<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I follow your suggestion ( I read your bool SL 4 unleashed, and hear your video too ). I'm in the middle of learning a lot stuf for building my own application.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no problem in this scenario, because I can do this :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CustEditView dlg = new CustEditView();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dlg.showDialog();<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wired a CustEditView with CustViewModel from ViewModelLocator, from blend.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is no problem on this scenario. ( CustViewModel is created when View is created ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. On the EDIT Scenario, I NEED to pass a parameter ( cust id ) to a view model ( CustViewModel ) [ BUT the reality is i have already bound / wire that ViewModel with View from blend ].<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already solve this problem in this way ,but I don't know is it good ? or any suggestion better ?<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution One :<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ON THE CustViewModel ]<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; on the CustViewModel constructor i registered a message which is receive a cust id parameter. and then in the method that handle that message\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I load a cust object based on that parameter.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; If cust id is -1 ( my convention ) I load a new Cust Business Object.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; if cust id is no -1 ( which is cust id ), I load a Cust Business Object which have that cust id number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; [ On The Caller CustEditView ] = [ Caller VIEW Code Behind ]<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I do these :<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CustEditView dlg = new CustEditView();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Messenger.Default.Send&lt;string&gt;(cust_id); // this message will be handled with above message handler to load correct customer business object.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dlg.showDialog();<br>\r\n&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this solution i still have an access on ViewModel from ViewModelLocator ( because CustViewModel is bound from ViewModelLocator property )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this solution is good, or there is another better solution for this scenario ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. What I will want to try for another solution is :<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will create CustViewModel from Caller VIEW Code Behind. Like this :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; CustEditView dlg = new CustEditView();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; dlg.DataContext = new CustViewModel(cust_id);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; dlg.ShowDialog();<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; So I wire a ViewModel and View from Code Behind of My Caller View.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; On My Mind, I have a reasoning like this : I just used CustViewModel from ViewModelLocator for BLENDABILITY purpose when i'm doing design view on blend ONLY.\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp; <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; AND when runtime I used another view model object (&nbsp; different from ViewModelLocator property ), Is this OK ? Good ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; In your opinion which is better solution no 2 or 3 ? could you explain the reasons for me ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If there are another suggestions is okay ...</p>\r\n<p>thanks a lot</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>stefanus</p>\r\n",

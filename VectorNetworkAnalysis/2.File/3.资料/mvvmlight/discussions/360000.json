This is because for the ViewModelLocater\r\n is created twice and the SimpleIoc.Register calls are made twice. It would be useful if uncommenting this code led to a usable application.</p>\r\n<p>A simple workaround is to make the sample constructor of ViewModelLocator into a static constructor instead of an instance constructor.</p>\r\n<p>(Note: I'm using MVVM Light with VS 2012 and a Metro UI, I haven't investigated whether this is the same for the earlier stable versions).</p>\r\n",

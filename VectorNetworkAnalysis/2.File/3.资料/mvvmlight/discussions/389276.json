I found it useful in a couple of scenarios, and it could be a nice addition to your wonderful toolkit.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand I'm planning to swap out the ObservableObject and RelayCommand classes of MVVM Foundation with yours, that I found more complete.</p>\r\n<p>Just wondering if extract only the pieces I'm planning to use or include your full toolkit as a dependency... I know that the nightmare will be keeping the pieces from various toolkits in sync with authors updates!</p>\r\n<p>Paolo</p>\r\n",

I think they shouldn't conflict with each other. This will make it easier to upgrade to a next version, instead of having to maintain the code.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers<br />Laurent</p>",

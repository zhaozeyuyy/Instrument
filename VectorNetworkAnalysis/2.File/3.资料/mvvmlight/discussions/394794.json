So my doubt is, is there any advantage for dynamic view models over static view models. I think if i create\r\n static view models, while the time of application launching the memory will be allocated for all my view models and &nbsp;it may eventually increase my application's memory usage. How i can&nbsp;tackle this situation. I found in V 4.0. A SimpleIOC&nbsp;container&nbsp;is\r\n added along with the libraries, how i can make use of that. provide some samples or documentations that make me learn the technology easier. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

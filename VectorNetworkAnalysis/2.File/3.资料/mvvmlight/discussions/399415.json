My questions are then,</p>\r\n<p>* do you see this error on the apps you build?&nbsp; (if not, then I'm probably looking for something in my hardware setup, though I've tried this on two boxes)</p>\r\n<p>* and, if not, do you have any ideas as to where I might look?&nbsp; As I say, the BlankApp template didn't return an error but the base MVVM Light template app did (at least on my boxes).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

When you click back, the view gets &quot;destroyed&quot;, but the vm stays intact? &nbsp;When a user clicks another article, the process repeats. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My question is concerning those old views. &nbsp;Do the viewModels make a strong link to the views when properties are bound, and if so, how do you get around that. &nbsp;I'm trying to eliminate any potential memory leaks before they occur. &nbsp;When the\r\n view is destroyed, does that take care of the property changed events that were subscribed to?</p>\r\n",

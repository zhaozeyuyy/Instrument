If you're deriving from ViewModelBase, then other projects that use it need a reference to the libraries that contain base types. That's regular .NET and has nothing to do with\r\n PCLs. If you add the package to your store app, does that resolve the issue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nOren</p>\r\n",

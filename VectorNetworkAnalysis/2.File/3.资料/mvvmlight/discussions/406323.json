I think a lot of people are adding MVVM Light for a specific feature, maybe late in development and\r\n don't want their projects mangled by this code. Would you please consider removing it or at least consider the project type before adding it. Today I got an App.xaml file added to my UserControl project which I clearly do not want.</p>\r\n",

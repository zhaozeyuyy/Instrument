However I have added a menu bar and would like to display another window when a particular item is selected.</p>\r\n<p>I have experience with using the messenger, however I believe i'm failing to setup the ViewModelLocator properly, as the second window's code-behind never receives the message.</p>\r\n<p>A simple example application would be amazing...</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Chris</p>\r\n",

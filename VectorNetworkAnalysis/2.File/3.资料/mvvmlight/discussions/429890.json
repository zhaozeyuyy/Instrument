I have struggled quite a bit to keep my modules loose when it comes to functionality such as the following:</p>\r\n<p>A client module holds functionality for a client entity, strangely enough!!! A client, and many other entities, can have notes attached. So I have a notes module.</p>\r\n<p>From my ClientView I have an add new note button and an edit note button. I have struggled no end in an attempt to get my note view/edit view to display as a modal window without my other system modules holding a reference to the Notes module.</p>\r\n<p>Is this easily achievable with MVVM light? The&nbsp;PRISM framework&nbsp;seems to offer nice methods around this for Silverlight but not WPF?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>\r\n",

When I downloaded the latest version of Light I found that lots has changed since the release of that book(2011) and found it hard to follow their tutorials.\r<br />\n<br />\nI started to look for tutorials online but kept finding the same thing that the tutorials were out of date and could not be easily followed.\r<br />\n<br />\nI started to watch your videos that you did and they are great to get a person excited about Light toolkit but to use them as a tutorial(even with the source code) is very difficult.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am right now really stuck on how to even really use Light toolkit. I tried to learn from the source code but it is hard to follow.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think it would be great if some investment in tutorials. I know it is nice to keep adding more and more features but documentation and tutorials are just as equally important.\r<br />\n<br />\nSome topics I would think would be good would be<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Intro with MVVM light and WP7/8(plus any other projects)</li>\n<li>How to do navigation in WP7/8 with MVVM</li>\n<li>\nHow to do other events(onchange,mouse over and etc) in WP7/8 with MVVM<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThanks<br />\n",

I guess I will try to figure out how to use MVVM light one more time otherwise might have to try to find a toolkit with documentation as I can't really wait to for an unknown amount of time till documentation is available to start my project.<br />\n",

I am trying to follow it(some stuff has changed). but it does not really go into navigating and such. I tried to follow this tutorial: <a href=\"http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2011/01/06/navigation-in-a-wp7-application-with-mvvm-light.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2011/01/06/navigation-in-a-wp7-application-with-mvvm-light.aspx</a><br />\n<br />\nbut it really does not go into how to use it. Not sure if for now I should just stick to the basic click command and databinding and leave navigation and other events to the codebehind.<br />\n<br />\nNot sure if I will lose blend(what is a huge draw for me...anything that makes data binding easier)<br />\n",

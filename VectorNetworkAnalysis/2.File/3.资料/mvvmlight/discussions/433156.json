When I tried to use NuGet to install the package MvvmLightLibs to the PCL project, I get the following error message:\r<br />\n<br />\ninstall-package : Could not install package 'MvvmLightLibs 4.1.26.1'. You are trying to install this package into a project \r<br />\nthat targets 'portable-win+net45+wp80', but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are \r<br />\ncompatible with that framework. For more information, contact the package author.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I going about this the right way?  How can I use MVVM Light in my PCL so that I can share that library with my Win8 and WP8 projects at the same time?  I did install NuGet 2.2 before running this.  Thanks in advance for your help.<br />\n",

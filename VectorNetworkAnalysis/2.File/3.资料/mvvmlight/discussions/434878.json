You must add a reference to assembly 'GalaSoft.MvvmLight, Version=4.1.26.28028, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.\t&lt;Path to Windows Store App&gt;\\Common\\ViewModelLocator.cs\t49<br />\n<br />\nAdding a reference to the Portable.MvvmLight lib in the Store App causes ambiguous references, therefore more conflicts.<br />\n<br />\nAm I right that the normal MVVM Light library is too new, which confuses VS when trying to find the ViewModelBase in the older Lib where the PCL-Version is based off?<br />\n<br />\n[EDIT]<br />\nStore App Version: 4.1.27.22661<br />\nvs<br />\nPCL Version: 4.1.26.28028<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLooking forward to your help.<br />\nThanks for your awesome work you've done so far :)<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,<br />\nKai Eichinger<br />\n",

I removed the MVVM PCL version and added a reference to the normal MVVM Windows 8 DLLs ( GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Win8 and GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Extra.Win8). However, I'm not sure if everything's working if you use all features, though I'm kinda new to MVVM Light and didn't had the time to continue to work on my project.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyways, I can compile the whole solution without any problems if I add the reference to the normal Win8 version.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers~<br />\n",

So if you add a PCL with MVVM Light, you must then, in your app, unreferenced the MVVM Light assemblies and instead reference the PCL ones.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope it makes sense!\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nLaurent<br />\n",

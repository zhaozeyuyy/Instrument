The problem is, it is interfering with the WP8 (mscorlib) libraries that also have an implementation  of System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanging when I include the PCL libraries using NuGet in my WP8 project.  I can see that the libraries referenced are from the WP8 folder in the Portable.MVVM folder, but I don't think they should have this namespace implemented.  I also noticed them in the .NET 4.5 libraries as well.<br />\n<br />\nI am not sure what the right answer is here.  I understand you need the interface the MVVM Light PCL assemblies, but I wish there was a way to effectively switch them off when they exist within another environment like WP8.<br />\n",

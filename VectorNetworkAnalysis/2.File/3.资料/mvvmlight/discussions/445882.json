I am trying to go through the MIX11 video and I would think that my Product class would be my Domain class like the Friend Class is in the video.<br />\n<br />\nand this would be in my View Model class<br />\n<br />\npublic Product Product{ get; set; } <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHow I have it right now I don't seem to have a DataContext on the textbox(I do have it in my layOutRoot)). What I did was like in the video. I opened blend up and dragged my VieModelLocator onto the layoutroot and then I dragged the property from the product class onto a textbox I made.<br />\n<pre><code>        &lt;TextBox Text=&quot;{Binding Product.Name, Mode=TwoWay}&quot; Margin=&quot;257,211,0,0&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; Width=&quot;80&quot;/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nWhen I click the button I made a relay command that I grabbed off in some old book I had<br />\n<pre><code>        public RelayCommand AddAVendorCommand\n        {\n            get;\n            private set;\n        }</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>            AddAVendorCommand = new RelayCommand(() =&gt; AddVendor()); // in constructor of ViewModel\n\nRight now it just goes to the AddVendor method and I have a break point to see if what I put in the textbox show sup in the Product object.</code></pre>\n\n",

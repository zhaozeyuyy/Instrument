As you can see I don't want to hit the server before 3 characters are entered but after that it is fair game. I am kinda worried that like 20 requests will be done to the server before the 1st request makes it back leading to wasted bandwidth.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nFor some reason it seems like all my textboxes get the ICommand Event Trigger and I don't understand why. I click in another box and start typing and starts hitting my ICommand.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

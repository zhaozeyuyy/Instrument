I went to my list and went &quot;Edit Additional Templates -&gt; Edit Generated Items -&gt; Edit Current&quot;. \r<br />\n<br />\nI then deleted the checkbox and added a &quot;Sale icon&quot; into it. Now of course every item is not a sale item so I need to toggle(visibility) based on IsSale item.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am not sure if I should use state behavior like done in the 1st video or if I should do something like what was done in the second video with changing the rectangle to green.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I do the latter though I am not sure how to do it as in the video the &quot;DateofBirth&quot; was at the root level and not encapsulated in another collection.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I not sure how to access it and do what was done in the 2nd video. \r<br />\n<br />\nI tried doing state and it seems to work. I have 2 items one a sale item and one that is not and the icons show as expected however in blend they both sale icons are visiable so, I think that way kills blendablity?<br />\n",

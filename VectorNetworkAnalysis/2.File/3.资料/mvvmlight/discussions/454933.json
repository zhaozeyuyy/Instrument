You can hand crank a viewmodellocator, add a bootstrapper if required and change your app.xaml &amp; cs to change your app start-up (I'm assuming WPF).<br />\n",

    "Html": "Thanks for the clarification Ibugnion.<br />\nI am running into another issue.<br />\nI have resource files(of type .resx) that I have been trying to access through my MainPage.xaml . So I created an AppViewModelBase which is suppose to link to my color resx file, and English and French localization files. In such way (I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it though):<br />\nThis is the AppViewModelBase class:<br />\n<pre><code>namespace dictio.ViewModel\n{\n    public class AppViewModelBase : ViewModelBase\n    {\n        //Linking to Colors resource table\n        private static AppRsrc_Colors rsrcClr = new AppRsrc_Colors();\n        public AppRsrc_Colors Resources { get { return rsrcClr; } }\n\n        //Linking to English resource table\n        private static AppRsrc_ENG rsrcLgENG = new AppRsrc_ENG();\n        public AppRsrc_ENG Resources { get { return rsrcLgENG; } }\n\n        //Linking to French resource table\n        private static AppRsrc_FRN rsrcLgFRN = new AppRsrc_FRN();\n        public AppRsrc_FRN Resources { get { return rsrcLgFRN; } }\n        \n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\nBut now that there is already a datacontext linking to the ViewModelLocator class in my MainPage.xaml...<br />\n(based on the following code:)<br />\n<pre><code>    DataContext=&quot;{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}&quot;</code></pre>\n\n... how am I suppose to reference the AppViewModelBase class for the MainPage.xaml file to access property values of the different resource files by data binding?<br />\n(Example of binding in MainPage.xaml for a color in color resource table)<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;Setter Property=&quot;Background&quot; Value=&quot;{Binding base_bg_clr}&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>\n\n--Side note:--<br />\nVisual Studio didn't allow me to use another DataContext statement in MainPage.xaml .<br />\nAlso I read I could just make a class inherit from the AppViewModelBase, but I can't figure out where to plug the inheritance now that I integrate the MVVM toolkit. Is it a good idea to make the ViewModelLocator class inherit from AppViewModelBase.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,  This is pretty simple, but being utterly new to wp8 and mvvmlight, I'm not figuring this out.<br />\n<br />\nTo put simply:<br />\n  On my MainPage.xaml, on the application bar, I have a New Task button.    This is bound to a Command:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;behaviors:ApplicationBarIconButton Command=&quot;{Binding SaveNewTaskCommand}&quot;</code></pre>\n\nBut the SaveNewTaskCommand is in my NewViewModel.cs:<br />\n<pre><code>public RelayCommand SaveNewTaskCommand\n        {\n            \n            get { return new RelayCommand(SaveNewTask); }\n        }</code></pre>\n\n( .. and SaveNewTask simply navigates to my NewPage.xaml via:  _navigationService.NavigateTo(new <a href=\"mailto:Uri(@&quot;/View/NewPage.xaml&quot;,\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uri(@\"/View/NewPage.xaml\",</a> UriKind.Relative));  )<br />\n<br />\nHowever, nothing happens when I tap the New Task button. I'm guessing because I'm binding to a RelayCommand that's <strong>not</strong> in the MainViewModel<br />\n<br />\nSo I wasn't sure what the syntax is for specifying the correct context of that other ViewModel<br />\n<br />\nAny help is appreciated<br />\nSteve<br />\n<br />\n( p.s. I'm using the Cimalino toolkit for the appbar binding )<br />\n",

Not 100% sure on that one.<br />\n<br />\nIt might be better the use the messenger class, then in the viewmodel of your mainpage.xaml view you could send a message and as long as you subscribe to that message type in the NewViewModel class you can trigger your new task.<br />\n<br />\nA plan B anyway.<br />\n",

The VM can either be exposed through the ViewModelLocator in which case you can use:\r<br />\n<br />\nMyCommand=&quot;{Binding TheViewModel.TheCommand, Source={StaticResource Locator}}&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nor it could be exposed as a property of the MainViewModel (for instance), in which case you can do\r<br />\n<br />\nMyCommand=&quot;{Binding TheViewModel.TheCommand}&quot; if MainViewModel is already the page's datacontext or\r<br />\nMyCommand=&quot;{Binding Main.TheViewModel.TheCommand, Source={StaticResource Locator}}&quot; \r<br />\n<br />\nSo basically it's all a matter of finding the reference to the VM that contains the RelayCommand.

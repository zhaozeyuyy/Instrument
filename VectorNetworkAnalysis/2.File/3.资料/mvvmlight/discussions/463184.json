I found the following article and it seems the implementation would be fairly simple. \r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, I do understand that this framework is called MVVM Light for a reason, and this may not truly fit in with the spirit of your framework.\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://anthymecaillard.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/wpf-4-5-validation-asynchrone/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://anthymecaillard.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/wpf-4-5-validation-asynchrone/</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks \r<br />\nDon W.<br />\n",

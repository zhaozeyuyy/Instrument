I think I've uninstalled all the previous versions, but I probably have little bits and pieces left around.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyhow, I'm trying to install the latest 2012 version (MvvmLight.VS2012.vsix), and it installs the templates, but the DLLs are no where to be found. When I create a project using one of the templates, the compiler can't find the referenced DLLs either.\r<br />\n<br />\nI just want the DLLs.  I don't care about the templates<br />\n",

I have placed the GalaSoft MVVM libraries (MVVMLight.WPF45 and MVVMLight.Extras.WPF45) in a folder on my system.  I then replaced the references in the project with these files and set the Copy Local property to false.<br />\n<br />\nThe project compiles fine (no errors or warnings), but when run, I get this error:<br />\n<pre><code>System.TypeInitializationException was unhandled\nMessage: An unhandled exception of type 'System.TypeInitializationException' occurred in mscorlib.dll\nAdditional information: The type initializer for '[appName].App' threw an exception.\n</code></pre>\n\nBTW - I get the same result just setting the Copy Local property to false without replacing the references.  I am unable to set a breakpoint early enough in execution to catch the error.<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas?<br />\n",

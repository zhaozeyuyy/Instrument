I used nuget to add MVVM Light to my project. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe first issue I had was that I tried to register a ns using;\r<br />\n<br />\nxmlns:cmd=&quot;clr-namespace:GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Command;assembly=GalaSoft.MvvmLight.WPF45&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nThen tried;<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;cmd:EventToCommand Command=&quot;{Binding GridItemEdit}&quot; PassEventArgsToCommand=&quot;True&quot;/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nI didn't get any intellisense on cmd: until I changed the ns registration to;\r<br />\n<br />\nxmlns:cmd =&quot;<a href=\"http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvmlight\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvmlight</a>&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nAt this point my app would now compile and intellisense works.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I run my app, I now receive;\r<br />\n<br />\nCould not load file or assembly 'System.Windows.Interactivity, Version=4.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. \r<br />\n<br />\nI have used  Interaction.Triggers in other parts of my app with no issues. I am not sure why this is happening. If I remove the code <br />\n<pre><code>&lt;cmd:EventToCommand Command=&quot;{Binding GridItemEdit}&quot; PassEventArgsToCommand=&quot;True&quot;/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nThe app works fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nHelp!\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.\r<br />\n<br />\nGeorge<br />\n",

Real a splendid work.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm starting to learn it (discovering MVVM at the same time) and it is very helpful to get samples... :-)\r<br />\nEspecially on this IoC topic for which I've not fully understood all the intrincacies.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, in the above referred article (MSDN) it appears that the sample is no longer available (Archive Gallery has been retired). Would you mind to tell where I can get this Code Sample?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nChristian<br />\n",

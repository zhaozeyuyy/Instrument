It works only when the .config file and the Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll is in the same folder as the executable, other dll are not required.\r<br />\n<br />\n  The exact same project works fine as a standalone when using .Net 4.5 and the last mvvm light version, but as I need to downgrade the framework version to 4.0 (for windows XP) I can't get it to work any more.\r<br />\n<br />\n  Is there a way to make the project use the common service locator in a &quot;normal&quot; way, without the config file ?<br />\n",

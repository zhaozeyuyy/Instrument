    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nThe IValueConverter interface might cause you issues as it doesn't seem to be available on Xamarin.\r<br />\n<br />\nThat said, if you have conversion logic, you can leverage it using the Binding.ConvertSourceToTarget and Binding.ConvertTargetToSource methods. Since the SetBinding method returns a Binding instance, you can just call these methods there.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nLaurent<br />\n",

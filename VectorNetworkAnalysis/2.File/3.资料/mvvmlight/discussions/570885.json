I saw a blog post by the author of this toolkit, explaining why this was necessary, but can't remember where it was. You can probably find it with some searching. However, just adding &quot;Wpf&quot; to the end of the using will fix your problem without you having to call RaiseCanExecuteChanged yourself.<br />\n",

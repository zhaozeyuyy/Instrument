Question is if it is not somewhat time-limited (it will not work after half a year for example).<br />\nBut for now, I am limited to Visual Basic 2010 Express which does not support NuGet or other add-ins so I need binaries (I will not undergo this library source code compiling).<br />\n",

The Express editions are not supported anymore.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can possibly give you the DLLs but I do not compile on Visual Studio 2010 anymore and I don't test VS10 anymore either. That would be without any guarantee that it will work. If that's OK with you, fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nLaurent<br />\n",

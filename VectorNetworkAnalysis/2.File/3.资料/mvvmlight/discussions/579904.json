    "Html": "I am stucked with MVVM again. I am trying to send message from method in DLL library which is referenced and used in WPF application. This is for showing UI dialog from non-UI data service. It looks like message can not be delivered from library to application, even if application is correctly registered as recipient. I hope it is not something like both codes are running in different application domains or something similarly dreadful, which is preventing to use cool MVVM Light messenging. How to solve this problem?<br />\n",

Maybe some threading issue?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf you provide a repro, I am happy to take a look.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers\r<br />\nLaurent<br />\n",

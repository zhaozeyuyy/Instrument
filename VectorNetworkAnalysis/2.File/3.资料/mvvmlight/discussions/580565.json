Everything works great in the phone where I have several views and on windows where I only have 1 view.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have found the need only 2 or 3 times for the compiler directives #if WINDOWS_PHONE_APP. But I don't like using these directives in code. So I tried to create a VM for the phone and another for the windows project and inherit from the MainViewModel and place there the platform specific code.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this the way to go? How should my VMLocator look like having these two platform specific VMs? I almost made it work but my bindings stopped working :(<br />\n",

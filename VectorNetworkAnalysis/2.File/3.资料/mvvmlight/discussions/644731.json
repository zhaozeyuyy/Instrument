I've watched the Pluralsight course that Laurent put out on MVVM Light. It was good; in fact very good. But I'm sorry I'm still not getting navigation using locator. I could really use a concrete example app to see how its meant to be done.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan someone please point me to an example?<br />\n",

Is there a way to bind my data in this case with the framework? Or do I have to do it by myself? It would be nice I could do it with mvvm light...<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you check the ObservableTableViewController, it has a property named TableSource which gives you access to the created UITableViewSource . This property is of type ObservableTableSource&lt;T&gt; which is a protected class within the ObservableTableViewController. You can use GetController to create the Controller and then keep only the TableSource if you want. I will think of a better way to offer this property without having to create the ObservableTableViewController.\r<br />\n<br />\nLet me know if that helps\r<br />\nLaurent<br />\n",

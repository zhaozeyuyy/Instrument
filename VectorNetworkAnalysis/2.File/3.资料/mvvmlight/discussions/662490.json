As the final raise of the event is based on a string propertyname, I think it would be cool to have the &quot;Expression&quot; version to call the &quot;string&quot; version instead of raising the handler on his own.\r<br />\nIn the case you want to catch the RaisePropertyChanged event from a subclass, you would need to only override the string version to be sure to have all cases (name resolution from expression is already solved).\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers from Paris !<br />\n",

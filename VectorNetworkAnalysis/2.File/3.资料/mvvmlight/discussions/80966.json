    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>No you are not missing anything, this is correct.</p>\r\n<p>There are some ways around the lack of KeyBinding: Use an EventToCommand to map the Window's KeyDown event to a command, and pass the EventArgs to the command using the&nbsp;EventToCommand.PassEventArgsToCommand property and setting it to true. I show how to do this for a SL4 drag&amp;drop event here:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2009/12/17/silverlight-4-dragampdrop-with-eventtocommand.aspx\">http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2009/12/17/silverlight-4-dragampdrop-with-eventtocommand.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>This works for KeyDown events too.</p>\r\n<p>For CommandBinding: This is a feature I want to add in a next version. I will think if there is a work around more practical than to define your own event in the Window and calling the Command on the VM directly. Maybe I find a behavior somewhere to do that (in a temporary manner).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Laurent</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Description": "in my Models, derived from ObservableObject, i've implemented some deterministic cleanup (IDisposable or ICleanup) and needs clear all event subscriptions. typically this is done inside event-declaring class by setting eventhandler = null. this can not be done in derived classes because eventhandler is private field (automatically generated by event declaration). i suggests implement IDisposable or ICleanup in ObservableObject and clear event subscriptions here. or implement some protected method for same task",

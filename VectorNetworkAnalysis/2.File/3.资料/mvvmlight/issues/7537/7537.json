    "Description": "With the EventToCommand class, the command is not invoked when the associated element is disabled. Most of the time, it is a correct behaviour but sometimes, we would like to still invoke the command.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add a property on the EventToCommand class like this :\r\n\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Specifies whether the Command must be always invoked or only when the\r\n/// associated element is enabled\r\n/// </summary>\r\npublic bool AlwaysInvokeCommand\r\n{\r\n    get { return (bool)GetValue(AlwaysInvokeCommandProperty); }\r\n    set { SetValue(AlwaysInvokeCommandProperty, value); }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Executes the trigger.\r\n/// </summary>\r\nprotected override void Invoke(object parameter)\r\n{\r\n    if (AssociatedObject == null || !AlwaysInvokeCommand && AssociatedElementIsDisabled())\r\n    {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n",

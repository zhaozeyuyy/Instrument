    "Description": "I just installed using version 3.0.0.0 (Aug 5 2011, Stable) of the installer. I also went through cleanup process before too.\r\n\r\nThe above template (a copy is attached to this post) created looks old and malformed (I haven't checked any others):\r\n* It opens with <phoneNavigation:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class=\"$rootnamespace$.$safeitemname$\" .. etc. and ends with </UserControl>\r\n* It references xmlns:phoneNavigation=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Controls;assembly=Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Navigation\" - but the Navigation assembly has long since merged into phone assembly (see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaimer/archive/2010/06/28/migrating-apps-from-windows-phone-ctps-to-the-beta-build.aspx - this was ages ago).\r\n\r\nI have now verified this is an issue inside the MSI by doing an admin install:\r\nmsiexec /a GalaSoft.MvvmLight.V3.msi TARGETDIR=d:\\temp\r\n\r\nAnd checked \r\nD:\\Temp\\Common7\\IDE\\ItemTemplates\\CSharp\\Silverlight for Windows Phone\\Mvvm\\MvvmView.WP7.zip\r\n\r\nI guess the workaround is to not use the installer which is a shame.",

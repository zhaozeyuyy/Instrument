    "Description": "When trying to create a new project in VS2010, I select the MvvmLight (WPF4) template, and it gave me an error message about not being able to find ProjectForTemplate.csproj in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplatesCache\\CSharp\\Windows\\Mvvm\\MvvmLight.WPF4.zip\" .\r\n\r\nI changed the name of the file MvvmLight.WPF4.csproj to ProjectForTemplate.csproj and after doing so, I was able to create a project of project type \"MvvmLight (WPF4)\" in VS2010.\r\n\r\nI also tried creating a new project in Microsoft Expression Blend 4. When I have MvvmLight (WPF) or any of the native .Net project type's selected, the UI allows me to hit the \"OK\" button. However, when I have MvvmLight (WPF4) selected, the \"OK\" button is disabled.",

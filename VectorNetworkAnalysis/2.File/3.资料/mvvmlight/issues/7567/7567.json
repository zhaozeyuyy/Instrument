    "Description": "MVVMLight references Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation. But Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll is not build for Metro apps. It uses APIs that are not available in Metro / Windows 8 apps.\r\n\r\nWhen running the App Certification Kit on a new clean MVVM Light Windows 8 app it will fail with the following message:\r\nError: This application failed the supported API check.\r\nAPI System.Threading.Thread in System.Threading is not supported. Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll calls this API.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to remove the reference to Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation from the MVVM Light Extras project. Rebuild, fix the errors (removing the use of the interface). Then your MVVM app will pass certification.",

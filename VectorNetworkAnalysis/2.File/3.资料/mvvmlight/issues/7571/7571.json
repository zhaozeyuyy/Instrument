    "Description": "I develop a win 8 app. This is I noticed that the design data be not displayed. I've attached a demo project to demonstrate the behavior. I could reproduce the behavior several times.\r\n\r\nIssue 1:\r\n\r\n1. Open DesignDataIssue Project with VS 11\r\n2. If not, then open SettingPage.xaml design view -> PageTitle: \"Setting Title\" is visible\r\n3. Build Solution -> PageTitle is no longer visible and Error \"Object does not match target type.\" is displayed (DataContext=\"{Binding Setting, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\")\r\n4. Close and reopen SettingPage.xaml -> PageTitle: \"Setting Title\" is again visible\r\n5. Rebuild Solution -> PageTitle: \"Setting Title\" remains visible\r\n\r\nIssue 2:\r\n\r\n1. Open SettingViewModel.cs and comment out the constructor \"public SettingViewModel(INavigationService navigationService, ISettingService settingService)\". Uncomment the constructor with resourceservice argument \"public SettingViewModel(INavigationService navigationService, ISettingService settingService, IResourceService resourceService)\"\r\n2. Build Solution -> PageTitle is not visible and Error \"Das Ger√§t ist nicht bereit. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070015)\" is displayed (DataContext=\"{Binding Setting, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\")\r\n3. No Solution found! ",

      "Message": "This is not a fix but I'm putting it here in case it helps anyone.  Moving the DataContext assignment out of a resources child XML element to an attribute of the Page element seems to have helped.  In other words, I changed from this:\n\n<Page.DataContext>\n    <Binding Mode=\"OneWay\" Path=\"Main\" Source=\"{StaticResource Locator}\"/>\n</Page.DataContext>\n\nTo this:\n\n<Page\n    x:Name=\"pageRoot\"\n    x:Class=\"RecNote.Pages.Help\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n    xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n    mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n    DataContext=\"{Binding Mode=OneWay, Path=Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\" \n>\n\nAnd I could see my design data, no longer got the consistency check Exception in the design editor, and no longer got the compiler warning \"object type does not match target type\".  I have no idea why this helps.",

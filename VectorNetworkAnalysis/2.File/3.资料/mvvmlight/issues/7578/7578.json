      "Message": "Hi,\n\nHow do you bind to the RelayCommand? RaiseCanExecuteChanged will do just = that, raise the CanExecuteChanged event. If no one is subscribed to the = CanExecutedChanged event (such as through a Binding, for instance), then = the CanExecute method is never called. It is normal behavior.\n\nCheers,\nLaurent",

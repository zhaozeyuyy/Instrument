    "Description": "int myNum = 1;\r\nvar command = new RelayCommand(() => { myNum = 2;}, () => myNum == 1);\r\n\r\nIn the code above a button is bound to the command. Before the latest update it would work but now it does not. When trying to put a break point in the canExecute, it is never even triggered when it should be.\r\n\r\nFound a work around of making the variable myNum a field of the class. Could there be a scoping issue with local variables?",

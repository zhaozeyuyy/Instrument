    "Description": "[Modified error, see comment below]\r\nI'm using the latest binaries (4.1.27.22661) from NuGet and my project is mimicking the sample navigation project from your MIX talk, but no matter what I try, the ViewModel is never registered as an instance when I try using a key.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!SimpleIoc.Default.ContainsCreated<SeriesViewModel>(FolderGuid))\r\n     {\r\n          SimpleIoc.Default.Register(\r\n               () => new SeriesViewModel()\r\n               {\r\n                    FolderGuid = FolderGuid\r\n               },\r\n               FolderGuid);\r\n      }\r\nMainViewModel._navigationService.Navigate(typeof(SeriesView), FolderGuid);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be exactly what this person was experiencing:\r\n[http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/workitem/7565](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/workitem/7565)\r\n\r\nI wonder if the fix failed to make it to the Win8 binaries.  \r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "Message": "Ok, it's not exactly broken, but it's not working as you've written your original example anymore.  The following code you put in the OnNavigated Method of the view (modified for me):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (DataContext == null)\r\n            {\r\n                var FolderGuid = (string)navigationParameter;\r\n\r\n                if (!SimpleIoc.Default.ContainsCreated<SeriesViewModel>(FolderGuid))\r\n                {\r\n                    Debug.WriteLine(\"Item not found\");\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                var vm = SimpleIoc.Default.GetInstance<SeriesViewModel>(FolderGuid);\r\n                DataContext = vm;\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nDoes NOT work.  The ContainsCreated doesn't pull anything and returns.  If I comment out that section and just do the GetInstance method, it works just fine.",

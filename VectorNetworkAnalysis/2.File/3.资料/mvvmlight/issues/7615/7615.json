    "Description": "It appears that GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Extras.WPF4 have been compiled for .NET 4.5 by mistake. Surely they should be compiled for .NET 4.0?\r\n\r\n> The primary reference \"GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Extras.WPF4, Version=4.1.27.22692, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=1673db7d5906b0ad, processorArchitecture=MSIL\" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the assembly \"System.Windows.Interactivity, Version=4.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\" which was built against the \".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" framework. This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework \".NETFramework,Version=v4.0\".\t\r\n\r\nnic",

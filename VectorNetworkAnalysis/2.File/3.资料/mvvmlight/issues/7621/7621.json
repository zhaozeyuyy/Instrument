    "Description": "Hi\r\n\r\nI upgraded to Win 8.1, VS 2012 and installed MVVM Light Toolkit V4.1 for Visual Studio 2012. I then went and installed the templates but I don't see any Windows phone MVVM Templates.\r\n\r\nI been working on Windows Phone 7 Project before my upgrade(when I was on Windows 7, using VS 2010 and MVVM Light Toolkit V4 RTM)  so right now I can't even add a new MVVM view.\r\n\r\nHow can I correct this?",

      "Message": "Hi,\n\nAre you positive that you have Visual Studio 2013 installed? The log says that it cannot find VS13. If you are attempting to install for VS12, you need to use the VS2012 VSIX. \n\nAs an alternative, may I suggest installing from the Visual Studio Gallery? Simply select Tools, Extensions and Updates and then search for MVVM Light. This will automatically select the correct version.\n\nCheers\nLaurent",

      "Message": "Hello,\n\nI appreciate your response and am slightly offended.\n\nYour right, the log states the VS2013 installer could not find VS2013.  That's why I opened the issue.\n\nYes I'm positive that I have Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate installed on Windows 8.1 Enterprise. I also have VS2010 and VS2012 installed.\n\nYour software will install using NuGet, but you do not have a .Net 4.5.1 and Win 8.1 desktop compiled assembly. So I downloaded the source today and recompiled it so it will work under .Net 4.5.1 and Win 8.1 as a desktop DLL.\n\nI have not tried to recompile your installer or the snippets project yet.\n\nThank you for a great software project.\n\nRegards,\nHoward\n",

      "Message": "No offense was meant, you should see some of the support requests I get. Better check first ;)\n\nA few thoughts about the issue.\n* You need to run VS13 at least once for the VSIX to detect it. Did you do that?\n* Did you try the method I recommended, which is using the Tools, Extensions and Updates dialog in VS13 to install MVVM Light?\n* Regarding Nuget, your remark surprises me. Nuget should detect .NET 4.5.1 and propose the WPF 4.5 version of MVVM Light. What exactly happens when you use Nuget on your project?\n\nThanks\nLaurent",

    "Description": "I am having the same issue as another at the post of: [Warnings when compiling a new MVVM Light Win81 project](https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/discussions/498049) where I am getting several warnings about await not being called on asynchronous tasks and async methods running synchronous calls. Oh there is also a warning about the certificate not being found and not being valid for signing aswell. I understand that this probably should be in another issue report, but all these warnings come from a fresh install and a new project so I thought I would keep them together, here's the warning list just for an on page reference:\r\n\r\n``` 1>------ Rebuild All started: Project: MvvmLight1, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\r\n1>C:\\Users\\Robert\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2012\\Projects\\Windows Store\\MvvmLight1\\MvvmLight1\\Common\\UserControlBase.cs(60,17,60,60): warning CS4014: Because this call is not awaited, execution of the current method continues before the call is completed.

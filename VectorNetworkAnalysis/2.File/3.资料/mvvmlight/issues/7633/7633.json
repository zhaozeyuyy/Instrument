      "Message": "\n\nNote: the previous MVVM light library  version 4.2.30.0 did work, but it seems that this previous library is no longer in the Nuget repository.\n\nFound some old MVVM sources on my system and used those in my projects ans was able to compile again the WP7 project. So it seems there is something wrong in the latest Nuget package for WP7",

      "Message": "Probably related - there is a bug in the MVVM (PCL) NuGet package - in my WP8 project I use the EventToCommand in XAML. In version 4.2.30.0 all worked, but in 4.3.31.0 it's no longer working, because the GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Platform.dll assembly is actually built for WP8.1, not WP8!\nI had to revert to previous version of that package to continue the development.\n\nNote I have also a question, why is there separate wp8 and wpa81 folder in the NuGet package if there is already portable-net45+wp8+win8+wpa81 folder that works on that platform as well?",

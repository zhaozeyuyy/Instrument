    "Description": "The descrpition states that the Unregister instance method simply removes the instance and allows SimpleIoc to create a new instance of the class when it is called again. When unregistering, and trying to create a new instance, an exception occurs.\r\n\r\nI've looked into the code and have found that during the Unregister procedure, the factory is also removed which prevents SimpleIoc from creating a new instance. After commenting this bit out, it works. Not sure if there are any further issues that could stem from commenting this out though...",

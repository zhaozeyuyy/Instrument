    "Description": "Hello\r\n\r\nI just noticed that the CommonServiceLocator 1.2 (M.P.ServiceLocation dll) is delivered with the portable-net45+wp8+win8+wpa81 (from MVVMLight (PCL)v 4.3.31.2) and also included as dependency (>=1.2)\r\n\r\nIf prior installing PCL MVVMLight the CommonServiceLocator 1.3 is installed already then there's a conflict about different payloads for the same target assembly (as both MVVMLight and CSL are trying to push own version to Output).\r\n\r\nThis makes MVVMLight (PCL) incompatible with CommonServiceLocator 1.3\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nTG\r\n\r\n",

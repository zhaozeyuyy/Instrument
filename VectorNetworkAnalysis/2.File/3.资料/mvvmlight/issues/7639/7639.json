    "Description": "Hey there.\r\n\r\nI'm using the toolkit for long now, but there is one really serious bug in WPF. If I use the Generic RelayCommand and wanna pass a commandparameter from xaml then the CanExecute method is not updating if the parameter changes.\r\n\r\nI tested it with WP8 & Win8 and it is working there. I also tested it with MVVM Light Libraries Only PCL from last year (MVVM Light libraries only (PCL) 4.2.30.1) and there it was also working.\r\n\r\nPlease find the bug example in the attachment.",

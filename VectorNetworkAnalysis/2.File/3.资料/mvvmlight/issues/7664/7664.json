    "Description": "We're using a RelayCommand<T> with both an execute and canExecute delegate in our view model. \r\nIn XAML, we bind Button.Command to the command and Button.CommandParameter to the selected item of ListBox.\r\n\r\nIn version 4, whenever the user changes the SelectedItem of the ListBox, the RelayCommand<T>.CanExecute is re-evaluated with the new command parameter value. \r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to version 5, the RelayCommand<T>.CanExecute is never evaluated. Not when the Window is loaded (because the command parameter is null at that moment), but also not when an item is selected in the list box.\r\n\r\nPlease fix!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJoost",

      "Message": "Hi,\n\nCan you confirm:\n\n- that you are using WPF (I think so since you mention a Window)\n- that you are indeed on the latest version of MVVM Light (V5.0.2).\n\nThere was a bug with RelayCommand.CanExecute which was fixed in 5.0.2.\n\nThanks!\nLaurent",

I am working on a blog post to explain this more in details.\n\nDoing the following solves the issue:\n* Upgrade to MVVM Light Libs only V5.0.2 \n* Replace the GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Command namespace with GalaSoft.MvvmLight.CommandWpf \n\nThere is more technical detail about this issue here:\nhttps://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/workitem/7659\n\nCheers\nLaurent",

    "Description": "Recently, we  have decided to integrate  Mvvm Light in our Android project to take benefits of binding features (actually, we make manual binding through events in our activities). I tried to make a binding on the SelectedItem property of a ListView but i did not succeed. I want to know if the current implementation of the Binding handle that. Can some one show me an example? thanks in advance\r\n",

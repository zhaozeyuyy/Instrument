To be clear, CommonServiceLocator V1.3 is supported on WPF 4 projects (but not on WPF 3.5).\n\nCan you make sure that you have the latest Nuget version?\n\nThanks\nLaurent",

At home this work just fine.\nMy work PC has no direct internet access, so I've downloaded the VSIX file (VS2012) on another PC, and brought it to that work PC on some CD / DOK.\n\n\"Do I understand correctly that you are creating the WPF4 project using the installed project template (File, New, Project, MVVM Light (WPF4))?\"\n- That is correct.\n\nI'm unable to update the Nuget, unless there is some way for me to download redest version (offline standalone EXE that does not require me direct internet access).\n\nDo I need to manually install the \"CommonServiceLocator V1.3\" for this to work properly ?\n\nregards,\nIdan",

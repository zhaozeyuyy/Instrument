    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI had been using 4.4.32.1 of mvvmlight, and recently updated to the latest version 5.0.2 using the package manager. it seem to install ok, but when I went to build the project I was receiving a conflicting dll error.\r\n\r\nThe system, mscorlib and  system.runtime were the dlls it was complaining about, after much checking I discovered that the issue appears to be with Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll and the fact that is seems to be referenced against .net 2.0.0.5. I couldn't find a new version of this dll, so to test that I was in the right area I rolled mvvmlight back to 4.4.32.1 and sure enough it all compiled correctly.\r\n\r\nJust wondering is there an issue with 5.0.2 and the Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.dll? is there something else I need to be doing when using 5.0.2?\r\n\r\nI will try updating it again now I know what to do to get it back, to see if it was just a one off issue.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n",

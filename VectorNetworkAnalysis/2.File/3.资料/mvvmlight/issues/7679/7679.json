    "Description": "We are attempting to use MVVM Light in a Xamarin.iOS project, and when installing the toolkit through NuGet the \"GalaSoft.MvvmLight.Platform\" DLL only downloads in Xamarin.iOS projects targeting the older MonoTouch10 runtime, but not the newer 64-bit compatible Xamarinios10 runtime. Can the package be updated to support and target the newer runtime? Thanks!",

The sample can be found here:\nhttp://1drv.ms/1xt11xu\n\nI will update the Nuget package ASAP. I have a few other things I want to take care in this release. In the mean time, the DLLs here should help you to port your app.\n\nCheers\nLaurent",

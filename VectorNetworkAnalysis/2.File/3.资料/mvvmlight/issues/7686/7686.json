    "Description": "I have a page where I check if the user is logged or not in the `Activate` method, and if there is a session, I navigate to some other page, something like this:\r\n```\r\npublic void Activate(object parameter) {\r\n    if(userLogged) {\r\n        this._navigationService.NavigateTo(\"MyPage\", \"args\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI found that this does not work. For it to work I have to Delay about 100 miliseconds before doing the navigation. So it looks something like this:\r\n```\r\npublic async void Activate(object parameter) {\r\n    if(userLogged) {\r\n        await Task.Delay(100);\r\n        this._navigationService.NavigateTo(\"MyPage\", \"args\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, I'm not sure if this should be the normal behaviour or not, but I think my scenario is pretty reasonable. So if this is not an issue please explain me how I could correctly do this.\r\n\r\nRegards.",

      "Message": "Hi,\n\nNavigation on Android devices is synchronous, so I don't see why this should happen in your application. \n\nIs userLogged a field or a property? Does it do something which could explain why the delay is needed?\n\nThanks\nLaurent",

      "Message": "Hi,\n\nI investigated the issue. It seems to be a problem of the Windows Phone Frame. I will pass this bug to the Microsoft phone team and will let you know what they say. I am a bit reluctant to fix that right now without getting their input first. \n\nInstead of delaying with Task.Delay, you can also use:\n\n```\nDispatcherHelper.RunAsync(\n    () => _navigationService.NavigateTo(NavigationConstants.ThirdPage, \"args\"));\n```\n\nWhat this does is put the navigation instruction at the end of the instructions queue on the UI thread. This gives the device the time to process all UI instructions first before the navigation occurs. More efficient than the Task.Delay, but still a hack anyway.\n\nI'll report back here when I find something out from the Windows Phone team\n\nCheers\nLaurent",

    "Description": "I installed version 5.1.1.0 from 4.2.32.7 and all of my command bindings broke.  I was trying to figure what was going on for a while and then observed that if I manually call RaiseCanExecuteChanged on a command then it refreshes CanExecute and determines whether a command can be executed.  I was not about to go through all of my code and make sure that I'm calling that manually everywhere, so I reverted back to 4.2.32.7 and everything is back to normal.  Please look into it.",

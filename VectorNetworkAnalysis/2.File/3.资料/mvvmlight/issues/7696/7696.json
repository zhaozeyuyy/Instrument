I am going to extract this to a separate assembly (and nugget package) because of the dependency on the Support.V4 and Support.V7 assemblies.\n\nOnce you have the dependencies in place, you can use the Vm.Items.GetRecyclerAdapter extension method to get an ObservableRecyclerAdapter and then you can set it as the RecyclerView's adapter. I will also publish some samples showing how to use this. \n\nI hope you like it!\nLaurent",

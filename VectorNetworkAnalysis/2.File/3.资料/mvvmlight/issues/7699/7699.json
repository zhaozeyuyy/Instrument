    "Description": "I would like to see the Messaging classes extracted into a separate NuGet package so that I can use them separately (I'm currently working with a WinForms app which would benefit from the Messaging system). My initial look through the code seems to show that the only dependency is WeakAction? I suppose that this would mean that you would have to move the 4 Weak classes into yet another NuGet package as well?",

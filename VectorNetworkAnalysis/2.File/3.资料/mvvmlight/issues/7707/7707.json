    "Description": "hello, I always getting an error in vs 2015 when I am using mvvmlight with an android project. Every time reference to any mvvmlight object occurs the error. I can run the application, but vs marks this as an error. The error says: Error\tCS0012\tThe type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0. The error occurs in the sample flower project too.",

That works well and no problem with having the same solution open at the same time jet. \n\nIn VS2013 install the rosslyn compiler to be able to run C#6 code from vs 2013. (you still get a lot of code error but compile works)\n\nUse vs2013 to edit XAML and VS2015 to edit your models. \n\nRun from either of the two environment.,\n",

    "Description": "Hi,\r\nAre you facing this issue ? It seems that many samples do not work on Windows 7 and VS 2013.\r\nSometimes, Windows 8.1 is required (for Windows Phone support) but sometimes it's more tricky.\r\nFor instance, I cannot start the \"Flowers\" sample because of missing references and other errors.\r\nRegards",

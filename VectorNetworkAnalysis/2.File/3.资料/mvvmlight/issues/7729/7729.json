    "Description": "VS Pro 2015 14.0.25123.00 Update 2 won't create a new project using MvvmLight (Win10Univ) [also tried WPF and same result]:\r\n\r\nPackage Installation Error\r\n\r\nCould not add all required packages to the project. The following packages failed to install from\r\n'C:\\USERS\\DAVE\\APPDATA\\LOCAL\\MICROSOFT\\VISUALSTUDIO\\14.0\\EXTENSIONS\\ATHAMX0R.LYW\\Packages':\r\n\r\nCommonServiceLocator.1.3 : Solution is not opened or not saved.\r\nPlease ensure you have an open and saved solution.\r\nMvvmLightLibs.5.2.0.0 : Solution is not opened or not saved.\r\nPlease ensure you have an open and saved solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, opening a new blank project and using Package Manager Console to run\r\nInstall-Package MvvmLight\r\n\r\nto install 5.3 results in a partial install of some parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVS2015 isn't exhibiting this behavior with other templates.  Uninstalled Extension for MvvmLight and reinstalled.  No change in behavior.  Uninstalled Extension for MvvmLight and installed 5.3 to a blank project via Nuget Package Manager. Get the partial install of some parts.\r\n\r\nFor some reason they no-likie.  What should be investigated?",

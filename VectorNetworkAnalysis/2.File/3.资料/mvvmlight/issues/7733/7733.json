      "Message": "Hi,\n\n\nWhile we take care of being as weak referenced as possible, it is possible that some edge cases create issues. I will take a look as soon as I can. In the mean time, please detach the binding before your objects get disposed, for example when you navigate away from the page containing the binding.\n\nThanks\n\nLaurent",

      "Message": "Hi,\n\nAny updates on this?\nI do follow your advice and detach binding when I don't need them any more, but sometimes there is no place you can detach. For example when using bindings inside UITableViewCell which has no explicit lifetime.\n",

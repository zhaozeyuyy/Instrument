    "Description": "The error is very obvious:\r\n\r\n_Cannot find App.xaml in this project, no other changes made. If you are installing in a PCL, please use \"MVVM Light Libs Only\" instead._\r\n\r\nThis is because there is no `App.xaml` file in a VB.NET project, but there is an `Application.xaml`, with the same content. I can't possibly know what Microsoft developers where thinking when they took the decision to name them differently in C#/VB, but that's how things are.",
